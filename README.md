This started as a commercial project with investment of around 20k USD where I had hired freelancer to create a Wordpress based plugin however the plugin didn't meet my expectation so I am making it opensource to get best of minds in Wordpress development. 
<b>Currently plugin allows users to:</b><br>
*Add/Edit/Delete Table heading from admin<br>
*Block/Ban users by admin<br>
*Approve/Unapprove user by admin<br>
*Block IPs by admin<br>
*Add by short code with Table ID<br>
*Manage Link and description by admin<br>
*Automatic Upgrade System for Plugins<br>
*Share table and Links on social sites<br>
*Like/Unlike post from front-end<br>
*Open link in the popup box/shadow box<br>
*Create small instant web preview of links<br>

<b>Things that need to be done:</b><br>
*Remove references to Easy Digital Download Software Licencing APIs/Services to make it Free<br>
*Make this plugin in responsive CSS so it can automatically scale as per the page width/also consider allowing user to add custom css<br>
*Better validation on links as well as remove the bug where some long links get truncated<br>
*Try to make link submission more safe by adding the trust score from https://www.mywot.com/en/api or using any of https://www.programmableweb.com/category/reputation/api<br>
*Option to sort link submission Cronologically or by Popularity (based on Votes)<br>
*Ability to just read clean text version (extracted) shadowbox popup/iframe, if the link submission is referenced to articles.<br>
*Ability to preview destination page by hovering mouse. <br>
*Clean overall code base and create documentation for others to refer. <br>
